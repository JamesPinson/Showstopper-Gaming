            <p> Welcome to the official website of The Showstopper Gaming. This website was created at the start of 2022 as a way to combine my love for gaming with web development.
                You can watch my livestreams directly on the homepage. You can view my youtube series as well as past live streams.  </p>

            <p> My primary focus as a gaming content creator is on wrestling games. A lot of the new content will focus primarily on WWE 2k22 and eventually AEW. 
                I will run different series such as Career Mode, GM Mode, and My Faction. I also want to shout out the RSTR Gaming League which a lot of content will come from as well.
                RSTR Gaming is a great gaming community and one of the best leagues for WWE 2k games. 
            </p>

            <p> I hope you enjoy the website and all of my content. Please follow me on all content and social platforms to keep up with new releases.
                As always thinks for being a part of The Showstopping Squad and never stop stealing the show.
            </p>
